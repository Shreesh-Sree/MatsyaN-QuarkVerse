## üîß Technical Improvements

### Google Maps API
```typescript
// Before: Basic loading
script.src = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=${apiKey}&libraries=places,geometry&callback=initMap`;

// After: Optimized loading
script.src = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=${apiKey}&libraries=places,geometry&loading=async&callback=initMap`;
```

### Modern Marker Implementation
```typescript
// Modern AdvancedMarkerElement with fallback
if (google.maps.marker && google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement) {
  const marker = new google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement({
    position: location,
    map: map,
    content: customElement,
  });
} else {
  // Legacy Marker fallback
  const marker = new google.maps.Marker({ /* ... */ });
}
```

### Text-to-Speech Implementation
```typescript
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
utterance.lang = locale === 'ta' ? 'ta-IN' : 'en-US';
utterance.rate = 0.8; // Optimized for clarity
```

## üìä Performance Optimizations
